Constants for Alien Invaders

This module contains global constants for the game Alien Invaders. These
constants need to be used in the model, the view, and the controller. As these
are spread across multiple modules, we separate the constants into their own
module. This allows all modules to access them.

### USE COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS TO CHANGE NUMBER OF ALIENS IN A ROW"""
"""
sys.argv is a list of the command line arguments when you run Python. These
arguments are everything after the word python. So if you start the game typing

    python invaders 3 4 0.5

Python puts ['breakout.py', '3', '4', '0.5'] into sys.argv. Below, we take
advantage of this fact to change the constants ALIEN_ROWS, ALIENS_IN_ROW, and
ALIEN_SPEED.
